Collect data from https://gplay.bg/. We are interested in products that are listed in two categories – “Периферия” and “Хардуер”. 
Every category has several subcategories. Your goal is to crawl (navigate) through all of them, and scrape all of the products, that meet the following criteria:
•	it has to be available (has status – “наличен”)
•	it costs less than 200 leva (doesn’t metter if the product is in promotion or not)

For each of them you can collect the information listed below:
(Lets take this mouse for example: https://gplay.bg/spartan-gear-talos)
•	category – “периферия”
•	subcategory - “геймърски-мишки”
•	title - “Spartan Gear Talos” 
•	subtitle - “Геймърска мишка Spartan Gear Talos, черен”
•	product number – “SG-033885”
•	price – “15.00”

Requirements:
•	use scrapy framework to retrieve the data
•	create and implement JSON Schema validation pipeline for processed items
•	use sqlite3 to store the data (Design your application wisely, so it can store every product just ONCE in database, no matter how many times user executes it.)

TIP: Prices can change in time, try to track that change and keep your database up to date.
